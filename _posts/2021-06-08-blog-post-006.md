The Biden administration had several announcements this week for offshore wind development: the "30 by 30" plan sets a goal of 30 Gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030; the New York Bight region, off of New York and New Jersey, is designated for expedited lease approvals; and the administration plans to offer $3 billion in loan guarantees for offshore wind.


News of this announcement was featured on the [front page of the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/climate/biden-offshore-wind.html?smid=url-share). See also the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/03/29/biden-wind-power/).

This news follows the announcement from earlier this month that [BOEM completed its environmental review of the Vineward Wind project](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-completes-environmental-review-offshore-wind-project) off of Massachusetts.
